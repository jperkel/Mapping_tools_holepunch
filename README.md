# Mapping-tools-examples

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jperkel/Mapping-tools-examples/master?urlpath=rstudio)

Simple examples of mapping in R, created for a Nature Toolbox article by Jeffrey Perkel, published 5 June 2018. [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05331-6]

Click the 'Launch Binder' button above to launch an interactive RStudio session in the cloud, in which you can explore and execute two RMarkdown notebooks. (Executable versions of these examples also are available on [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/capsule/4725205/tree/v1) and [Nextjournal](https://nextjournal.com/jperkel/mapping-examples-in-nextjournal).)

The JSON files in this directory were created using the Ogre ogr2ogr web app (https://ogre.adc4gis.com/), using Shape files from [al112017_5day_020.zip](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gis/forecast/archive/al112017_5day_020.zip).

Live versions of these documents are also available at:

Thanks to Anthony Gitter ([@anthonygitter](https://twitter.com/anthonygitter)) for help getting the Binder implementation to work.
